DevOps is a Software Development approach that aims to integrate development and operations to enhance collaboration and communication between them, and to automate and streamline the software development and delivery process.

DevOps combine the practice of Software Development (Dev) with Operational procedure (Ops) required to deploy and maintain the software application.

The primary goal of DevOps is to create more agile and efficient software development process, by breaking down the barriers between developers, operations engineers and stakeholders involved in software development and by promoting a culture of collaboration, continuous improvement and automation.

DevOps involves use of various tools and technologies, including version control, continuous integration & delivery (CI&CD) pipelines, configuration management tools, monitoring and analytics tools and cloud computing platform.

What is Automation, Scaling and Infrastructure ?
Automation refers to the process of using tools, scripts and technologies to automate the repetitive task in software development process. By automating tasks such as testing, deployment, monitoring, development team can improve efficently, reduce errors, and ensure that their software is delivered more quickly and reliably.

Scaling refers to the ability of the system to handle the increased workload. For example, a website that handles 10,000 visitors per day maybe need to scale up to handle 1,00,000 visitors per day.

Infrastructure refers to underlying hardware, software and network components that support an organization's IT system. This can include storage device, servers, networking components and software applications.

Automation, scaling and Infrastructure are closely related. Automation can help to scale the IT system more efficiently by reducing the amount of manual work required to manage and maintain them, Infrastructure plays an important role in automation and scaling efforts by providing necessary hardware and software components to enable these process.
